# Project 4: OOP Game Show App
 In this project, I created a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." I used JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.
 
 Some of the extra features that I added include the following:
 1) Added a background image during the actual play 
 2) Added sound effects to the game when the game has been won/lost
 3) Changed up some color styling to reflect personal preferences
